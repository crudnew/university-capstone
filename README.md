Capstone Project   -  University Computer Science Degree -  2020/2021

Myself, 3 other students and a Professor/Supervisor created a website for my CMPT 496 (Capstone) class at MacEwan University. It involved front-end, back-end, and database management/development. This website consisted of a map page, a statistics page, a login/signup page, and a "add crime" function. The website used pre-existing crime data from Edmonton, and mapped them on an interactive Google Map. Additionally, users were able to view a variety of crime statistics regarding crime types, locations, etc., as well as create an account and add crimes to the map. Consisted of: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, Apache2 and MySQL.
